# SENG-641-Project

Group project on software evolution and reuse.
We targeted 3 open source repositories, and then we did Manual, Lexical, and Semantic analysis to analyze and get the needed results.

These results were in the form of dependency graphs, tables, charts, and data output.
We implemented TF-IDF in java to get the necessary data, and used the CDA (class dependency analyzer) tool to get our dependency graphs for verification. 

The detailed project report is also uploaded.
